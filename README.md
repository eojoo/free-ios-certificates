# Free Apple Enterprise Developer Certificates

Welcome to the Free Apple Enterprise Developer Certificates repository!

### Introduction

This project aims to provide a collection of free Apple Enterprise Developer Certificates for developers and organizations who want to deploy and test their iOS apps without the burden of purchasing these certificates. Apple Enterprise Developer Certificates enable you to distribute apps internally within your organization without going through the App Store, making it a valuable resource for in-house app development and testing.

### How it Works

In this repository, you will find a curated list of Apple Enterprise Developer Certificates, along with instructions on how to use them in your iOS development workflow. All of these certificates come from public sharing on the internet.

### Important Notice

**Please be aware that Apple or owner of the certificate may revoke Enterprise Developer Certificates at any time.** Using revoked certificates can lead to your apps becoming non-functional on iOS devices. To avoid any disruptions, we strongly recommend that you regularly check for updates in this repository and download the latest available certificates to replace any existing ones. This proactive approach will ensure the continuity of your iOS app development and testing.

### Disclaimer

Please note that the use of shared Apple Enterprise Developer Certificates may be subject to Apple's terms and conditions. Ensure that you are aware of and comply with Apple's policies before using these certificates. The contributors and maintainers of this repository are not responsible for any misuse or violation of Apple's policies.
